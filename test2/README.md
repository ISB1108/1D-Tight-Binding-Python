\## Onsite Energy Shift



We study the effect of onsite energy E₀ on the band structure of a 1D tight-binding model.



Changing E₀ shifts the entire band rigidly without modifying the bandwidth, which remains 4t.

This demonstrates that the onsite energy controls the band center, while the hopping parameter t determines the band dispersion and bandwidth.
