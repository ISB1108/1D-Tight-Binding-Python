\## 1D Tight-Binding Model: Finite Chain



This project studies the energy spectrum of a one-dimensional tight-binding chain with a finite number of lattice sites.



For a finite chain, the energy levels are discrete and are labeled by an integer quantum number n.  

The energy levels are given by



E\_n = E\_0 - 2t cos(nπ / (N + 1)) ,



where N is the number of lattice sites and t is the hopping parameter.



In the figures below, the discrete energy levels for different system sizes (N = 10, 30, 100) are plotted together with the continuous energy band of the infinite lattice,



E(θ) = E\_0 - 2t cos(θ) .



As N increases, the discrete energy levels become denser and gradually approach the continuous band structure of the infinite system.
