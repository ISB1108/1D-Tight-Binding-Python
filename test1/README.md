# 1D Tight-Binding Model (Python)

This project demonstrates the electronic band structure of a one-dimensional
tight-binding model with nearest-neighbor hopping.

## Model
The energy dispersion is given by:

E(k) = E0 - 2t cos(ka)

where t is the hopping parameter and E0 is the onsite energy.

## Results
Increasing the hopping parameter t leads to a wider bandwidth,
indicating enhanced electron delocalization.

## Future work
- Effect of onsite energy shift
- Disorder in onsite energy
